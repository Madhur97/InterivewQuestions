Round 2 - LLD
        Design Splitwise

        N number of groups
        each group contains M number of users

        Assume groups and users are prefilled.assume group already has users.
                groupID(1) - A,B,C
                groupID(2) - A,C,D


        1. split bill - adds a bill/transaction
        2. show transactions of each user (who owns whom) , input (user)
        3. show transaction which occurred in the group




        2)

        user B

        -A paid 30k, you own him 10k
        -You paid 30k, you will get back 20

        3)

        A  0
        B  0
        C  0

        transaction 1) A paid 30k

        BALANCE

        A +20k
        B -10k
        C -10k


        transaction 2) B paid 30k

        BALANCE

        A +10k
        B +10k
        C -20k
